        "1": "One of the original 802.11 wireless standards; October 1999",
        "2": "Operates in the 5 GHz range",
        "3": "54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)",
        "4": "Smaller range than 802.11b - Higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way; Many rules-of-thumb calculate 1/3rd the range of 802.11b or 802.11g"

        "3": "11 megabits per second (Mbit/s)",
        "4": "Better range than 802.11a (Less absorption problems); More frequency conflict (Baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth"

    "802.11g": {
        "1": "An “upgrade” to 802.11b - June 2003",
        "2": "Operates in the 2.4 GHz range",
        "3": "54 megabits per second (Mbit/s) (Same as 802.11a (but a little bit less throughput))",

        "1": "The update to 802.11g, 802.11b, and 802.11a - October 2009",

        "3": "600 megabits per second (Mbit/s); 40 MHz mode and 4 antennas",
        "4": "802.11n uses MIMO - Multiple-input multiple-output; Multiple transmit and receive antennas"
    },
    "802.11ac": {
        "1": "Approved in January 2014; Significant improvements over 802.11n",
        "2": "Operates in the 5 GHz band; Less crowded, more frequencies (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)",
        "3": "Increased channel bonding - Larger bandwidth usage",
        "4": "Denser signaling modulation - Faster data transfers",
        "5": "Eight MU-MIMO streams - Twice as many streams as 802.11n; Nearly 7 gigabits per second"
